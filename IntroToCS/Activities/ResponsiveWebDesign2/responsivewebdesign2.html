    <h1>Responsive Web Design</h1>
    <img src="Images/responsivewebdesign.gif" alt="Responsive Wen Design">
    <p>There are different approaches to creating responsive web pages. One approach is called mobile first. When designing responsive, you focus on sketching and protyping the smallest screen first and woork your way up to desktop designs. In mobile first design, the focus is designing for a phone, then tablets, then desktop computers, In reality we design for any screen either way.
        Although mobile first design works well, it is a good idea to also design the desktop website. In doing so you will discover additional elements needed in your HTML
    </p>
    <h2>Components of Responsive Web Design</h2>
    <h3>Media Queries</h3>
    <img src="Images/mediaqueries.png" alt="Media Queries">
    <p>Media queries are a fairly new technology in Web Page Design. They were introduced with CSS3. With media queries, you can create different layouts based on the size of the view port (browser window). Media queries only apply styles when certain conditions are met. Normally the conditions are the minimum or maximum width of the view port.</p>
    <h3>Responsive Images</h3>
    <img src="Images/responsiveimages.jpeg" alt="Responsive Images">
    <p>Since we are designing for multiple screen sizes, it is a good idea to provide images based on the size of viewport. We can easuly use the width or mad-width property to maxe an image responsizebased on the size of the view port. In addition, we can now use the new picture element to load different images based on the size of the view port.</p>
    <h3>Responsive Typography</h3>

    <p>Resoponsive typography adjusts the font size of your text based on the size of the view port. Phones and tablets have smaller viewports and therefore should, in many cases, have smaller font sizes. We will use the rem unit to create relative font-sizes based on the viewport size.</p>
    <h3>CSS Grid</h3>
    <img src="Images/cssgrid.png" alt="CSS Grid">
    <p>CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system for creating web pages.  It allows you to specify the number of columns and rows in your design.  More importantly it is well suited for responsive design because it automatically adapts to the size of the viewport.  When combined with media queries, it is a powerful and efficient way to create responsive designs.</p>
    <h3>Flexbox</h3>

    <p>Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system for creating web pages.  You can chose to layout your flex items horizontally or vertically.  More importantly, it allows you to easily create responsive layouts that can easily be adjusted with media queries.  It is often used in basic layout designs.</p>
